This repository demonstrates a common yet often-misunderstood error in Express.js applications where a server fails to start because the specified port is already in use by another process. The `bug.js` file showcases the basic Express server setup that doesn't handle the port-in-use scenario, and the `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution implementing proper error handling using `try...catch` block and alternative port selection.
